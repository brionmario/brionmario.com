# Create React App vs Gatsby vs Next.js

![Post Banner](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JIbwahXrdjFBqZ_VRhujXA@2x.png)

This comparison is an ongoing occurrence among developers when it comes to selecting the right option for a front end project.

When we consider these three technologies separately, we see a common denominator. That is [React](https://reactjs.org/) ⚡️

### What is React?

I’m not going to go into much detail but in layman’s terms, React is a front end JavaScript library that can be used to create UIs.

React is not a framework like [Angular](https://angular.io/) rather it mainly focuses on the view of an application.

### Then what are CRA, Gatsby & Next.js?

All of these are frameworks that are built on top of React. Each of these tries to abstract certain complexities of React to give better Developer Experience (DX) to the target audience.

Let’s look at one by one.

#### Create React App (CRA)

[Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) is created by the React core team hence it is considered as the official boilerplate for generating single-page React applications. CRA is based on a powerful [CLI tool](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#creating-an-app) and you can use this to customize how your application is scaffolded.

**🤔 When to use CRA?**

CRA is useful if you want to build an application that is single-page and renders on the client.

This is ideal if you want to build an application like an Admin UI which doesn’t require you to have multiple pages, optimized SEO etc.

### Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a static site generator that uses the power of React, [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). Gatsby also has a powerful [CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli/) which guides you step by step in order to create an optimal application based on the requirements.

**🤔 When to use Gatsby?**

Gatsby is ideal if you are building a static website. It can generate a multi-page super performant sites and the best thing about Gatsby is the rich documentation and ample plugin ecosystem.

If you need the best SEO support, look no further.

Gatsby also has a lot of starters to choose from and there are recipes of almost every use-case.

**Next.js**

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a lightweight framework which supports both client and server rendered applications. It has a lot of features out of the box for routing and styling and tries to abstract some of the complexities in React. Create Next App is the [CLI](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) tool for Next.js.

**🤔 When to use Next.js?**

Next.js is ideal for dynamic websites. With Next.js you get the flexibility on per page basis, whether to render on client side, server side or hybrid.

Next.js is highly performant and scalable. It supports lazy loading and the framework handles a lot of the complexity on behalf of the developer.

If you have a complex large application with a lot of pages, Next.js is ideal.

### Try them out

Rather than taking my word, it’s always best to try each of these out and select a framework which is suited for your use-case.

### Conclusion

Hope you found this blog post useful.
