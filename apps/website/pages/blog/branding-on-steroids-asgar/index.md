# Branding On Steroids

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8Xc8la1Vu5J7OafVyw21lg.png)

In a previous [blog post](https://medium.com/identity-beyond-borders/introducing-asgardeo-organization-branding-c0b8d66b8074) 👈, I introduced [Asgardeo Organization Branding](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/docs/guides/branding/) capabilities. And since then, we have added quite a few cool nifty features that could really help users to achieve advanced customizations whilst staying in the low code realm.

This blog post will take a sample scenario and compare the newly added capabilities.

### TL;DR:

To have a branding like the sign-in page of this application 👉 [https://drogo-nft-demo.web.app](https://drogo-nft-demo.web.app/), update the branding configurations of your organization with [these values](https://gist.github.com/brionmario/10dc6d1a60620aa6dd8a0208e771066d).

And also watch this how to view 👉 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSaNUMMN4&ab_channel=Asgardeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSaNUMMN4&ab_channel=Asgardeo)

### Scenario 🏜

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0obr30ejPhFU7t26csMRvQ.png)

**Drogo** is a new startup company that specializes in [NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token). They have a [marketplace application](https://drogo-nft-demo.web.app/) that is hosted on Firebase.

They want to let their users log in to their marketplace application and also they require to drive new users to register with their service via the application. This is where Asgardeo comes in. They’ve used the [Asgardeo React SDK](https://github.com/asgardeo/asgardeo-auth-react-sdk) to integrate login capabilities to the application.

Here’s the progress until now!

![Drogo Application initial flow](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7IgtkAcPgbvvFbEdQjxEgA.gif)

**Did you notice what’s lacking here?**

Of course, the branding transition sticks out like a sore thumb.

Let’s fix it. shall we…

### Get Started 🚀

I will first log in to [Asgardeo Console](https://console.asgardeo.io) with the credentials of my organization(`drogo`). And I will navigate to `Develop > Branding` to reach the branding feature.

![Branding Feature in Asgardeo Console](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*X03Tv9CTRk_jAKq-3Jo7UA.png)

> ⚠️ Always remember to **Go Live** if you want your changes to appear

### General Settings ⚙️

Here we can configure the general settings of the company branding. I will explain in brief what each of these fields does.

> Also, I will be adding the values i’m using so it’ll be easier if you decide to follow along 😉

#### **Site Title**

This is the text that appears in the browser tab when you shower over, in social media shares, etc.

_Value Used_

```js
Login | Drogo
```

### Design 🎨

#### Theme

This is the base for your design. We currently support **Dark 🌑** & **Light 🔆** variants to start with.

Since the Drogo NFT application has a darker tone, I will start with the Dark theme.

![Theme Selection](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-cbIJty0KxmM5RCIt_t2tA.png)

#### Theme Preferences

Now I can start customizing the overall look and feel based on the organization’s branding guidelines.

Following is the color palette salvaged from the company’s branding guidelines.

![Color Pallete](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Pazqfoi2xNTQ6mv8PSNanA.png)

#### Theme Preferences > Images

**Logo**

This is the image that appears on top of the Login Box. You can add a hosted URL of an image and also an [Alt text](https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text) for accessibility.

**Favicon**

This is the image that appears on the browser tab. You can also add a URL of a hosted favicon image here.
