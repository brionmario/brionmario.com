# Secure your dApps with¬†Asgardeo

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TYu_0kIUFnoVeSiV2JrD6A.png)

**Ethereum** is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. It is a blockchain-based platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).

**Decentralized applications (DApps)** are applications that are built on top of a decentralized, distributed ledger or blockchain. They are designed to operate in a decentralized manner, meaning that they do not rely on a central authority or intermediary to function.

As introduced in a previous [blog post](https://medium.com/identity-beyond-borders/asgardeo-the-next-generation-idaas-by-wso2-a089e5219ab7) üëà, **Asgardeo** is an IDaaS brought to you by the makers of the popular [WSO2 Identity Server](https://wso2.com/identity-server/). Asgardeo helps you build secure and frictionless authentication. So, you can focus on building your app.

Asgardeo recently released a new [Sign In With Ethereum(login.xyz)](https://login.xyz/) integration that would benefit dApp developers to secure their applications with very little effort.

> üí° What is Sign In With Ethereum (Login.xyz)?

> Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.

> Discover more from [here](https://login.xyz/)¬†.

üåü Let‚Äôs see how we can use Asgardeo to connect to an application with our Ethereum wallet.

#### Configure Asgardeo

Let‚Äôs create a connection on Asgardeo the Console with the Sign In With Ethereum(SIWE) template.

> If you are not yet registered on Asgardeo, follow [this guide](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/docs/get-started/) and set up your workspace inorder to follow this guide.

1.  Navigate to `Develop > Connections` and click on the `Create Connection` button.

![Connections view on Asgardeo¬†Console](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GicPXe7KNFSXSMpmYmkPpg.png)

2\. Select the `Sign In With Ethereum` connection type.

![Connection types on Asgardeo¬†Console](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RXvm-dO2T8-v732MC4-DbQ.png)

3\. In the wizard, we need to submit the `Client ID` and the `Client secret` of an OIDC client registered on the ethereum sign in provider (`oidc.signinwithethereum.org`).

We can simply use the autogenerated `curl` command in the help section to easily register a client.

Copy the `curl` and execute it on a terminal on your local machine. And grab the `client_id` and `client_secret` from the response and add it in the wizard and click on the `Finish` button.

![Sign In With Ethereum¬†Wizard](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JdGf09hvT1d7gYQrBEcNmA.png)![Response received when the curl command is¬†executed](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fJdIQS8q_C-3AOi6jbPBeg.png)

4\. Congrats üéâ! Now you have a SIWE integration configured on Asgardeo. How easy was that üòâ.

![Newly created SIWE integration](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xqj3jjcw53SRgC9G5lRZMg.png)

#### Connect your¬†dApp

Now that we have configured the connection on Asgardeo, it‚Äôs time to connect it to our application.

I‚Äôm going to use a demo application that i‚Äôve developed called **Drogo NFT Marketplace** which is a dummy NFT marketplace application that has items to be bought with Ethereum.

> I‚Äôve used the Asgardeo Auth React SDK and connected my application already with Asgardeo. You can follow the [official documentation](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/docs/guides/applications/) and connect your own application accordingly.

By default, the application supports basic login (username & password), Facebook, GitHub & Google login.

![Drogo NFT¬†Landing](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-1pPatRYWVm0aVu9pgL9TQ.png)![Drogo NFT¬†Login](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rj9c8RxlTklUlJ2RaFrG0g.png)

Let‚Äôs make this experience better by connecting our newly created SIWE integration.

1.  Go to `Applications > Drogo NFT` and navigate to the `Sign-in Method` tab.
2.  Click on the `Add Authentication` button.

![Sign-in Method tab of the application](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lSCnWh9pZJZZvhd-R1OyLQ.png)

3\. Select the newly created connection and click on the `Add` button.

![Adding the \`Sign in With Ethereum\` connector](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*atIAVKjhHLW9D94jHNuZKg.png)

4\. Click on the `Update` button.

![Update the configurations](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FwIpom_sfuX9S_Kv4jL1Ew.png)

Let‚Äôs initiate a login request in the application to see if our integration works.

![Drogo NFT Login with SIWE as a login¬†option](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ByZwtVAA5J_9L9m05Xsz_A.png)

‚≠êÔ∏è Now we can see that `Sign in With Ethereum` appears as a login option for the application.

When you click on it, you‚Äôll land on the sign-in page of the `oidc.signinwithethereum.org` and in there, click on the `Sign-In with Ethereum` button again.

![Login screen of \`oidc.signinwithethereum.org\`](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7I28A-SjOpzWZdCGChqAwA.png)

And then you‚Äôll be presented with a wallet selection. Select your prefered wallet. I‚Äôm going to use <a href="https://metamask.io/download/" class="fenced-link">MetaMask</a> wallet for the demo.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UMDKZV7CJfDHW_qVINFKUQ.png)

Once you select `MetaMask`¬†, `MetaMask` ‚Äòs browser extension will ask you to sign your request. Click on the `Sign` button to proceed.

![MetaMask Signature request](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TuNUbCwA6JYFH2cs4Kvglw.png)

Now you‚Äôll be redirected to your application üéâ¬†.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cvX6VFxOmco0MZlKe8kVlw.png)

Additionally, you can decode the `id_token` from the token response and see what kind of information you can gather from it.

![Sample decoded¬†id_token](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0ymL5PREPUVJ0dljT-4PlA.png)

> To see a hosted demo, go to [https://drogo-nft-demo.web.app](https://drogo-nft-demo.web.app/) and click on `Sign¬†In.`

### Concluding Remarks¬†üîö

I hope that you found this blog post useful.

Additionally, you can also refer to the official documentation on the SIWE integration [here](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/docs/guides/authentication/decentralized-login/sign-in-with-ethereum/).
